HI hello guys

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check if it's installed by opening your command prompt or terminal and typing:
python --version
If you don't have Python installed, download it from python.org and install it.

If you haven’t installed Flask yet, open your command prompt or terminal and run:
pip install Flask
Step 2: Organize Your Project Directory
Create Project Folder:
Ensure you have your project folder (e.g., login_simulator) with the following structure:
login_simulator/      (Folder)
├── app.py     (Python File)
├── credentials.txt  (will be created automatically)
└── templates/     (Folder)
    └── login.html   (Html File)
    Download the file that i gave you and assemble it in the above order
    the bracket show what are they like file or folder
    after this we going ru this on cmd
    Open Command Prompt/Terminal:
Navigate to your project folder. You can do this by using the cd command. For example:
cd path\to\login_simulator
Replace path\to\login_simulator with the actual path to your project directory.Run the Application:
Start the Flask application by running:
python app.py
